# Design Notes

Craigslist
Everything is categorized on the main page and has easy readibility.
This gets the job done but is not aesthetically pleasing. The main color on the
home page is blue and may not be able to differentiate between other elements.
The width whitespace is great but the vertical whitespace is too close. I do
like the green 'post' button at the top being the only other non-neutral color
that catches the attention and makes you want to creat a new post.
